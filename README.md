Name Ragulation:The first number is the chapter index, and the next one represent for the sub-chapter index, and so on. It's the character '_' between the number.

After chapter four, as the structure of the demmo of the book changed, the project contain no single file. I create a folder for it with the same name ragulation of files.

I find a defect of the book that I can't run the demo of the book that after lesson 06 in the visual studio 2017. So I drop the book. This repository would never be changed unless I find a solution of the serious problem.
